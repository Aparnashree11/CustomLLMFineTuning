# Custom LLM Fine-Tuning Platform

An end-to-end platform for fine-tuning and serving large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific datasets. Built with LoRA/PEFT, distributed training, and production-grade deployment.

## Recent Work
**Data Pipeline Implementation** → For detailed information checkout [Data-Pipeline README](Data-Pipeline/README.md) 

## Key Features

**Fine-Tuning** → Parameter-efficient training (LoRA/QLoRA) on user datasets.

**Scalability** → Distributed systems for fast training.

**Experiment Tracking** → MLflow integration with auto-generated model cards.

**Serving** → FastAPI + Docker/Kubernetes deployment with GPU batching.

**Monitoring** → Drift detection, performance dashboards, and feedback loops.

## How It Works

Upload dataset → preprocessing & validation.

Fine-tune base model (StarCoderBase, LLaMA, Falcon).

Track experiments and metrics.

Deploy model as an API endpoint.

Monitor → retrain with new data.

## Example Use Cases

FinTech copilots trained on regulatory codebases.

Healthcare assistants fine-tuned on medical knowledge.

Enterprise AI copilots for private code repositories.
